# [project 1: British Airways Dashboard(https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/yashwanth.yadav.kanneboina/viz/BritishAirwaysReview_17395879748950/Dashboard1)

This Tableau project provides an in-depth analysis of British Airways customer reviews to explore satisfaction across various aspects of the flying experience, including seat comfort, cabin staff service, food and beverages, ground service, value for money, and entertainment. Using a dataset of 1,324 reviews containing flight details such as aircraft type, traveler type, seat class, routes, and ratings, the project compares satisfaction levels across different traveler categories and seating classes. It also examines geographical patterns by linking review locations with a country information dataset containing 251 countries and their corresponding codes, continents, and regions. The dashboard includes interactive visualizations such as a map to display the geographical distribution of reviews, graphs to showcase overall satisfaction trends, and bar charts to provide a detailed breakdown of ratings for various service aspects. These visualizations help identify strengths and areas for improvement, compare experiences between business and leisure travelers, and highlight satisfaction trends for different routes and aircraft models. This comprehensive overview enables British Airways to understand customer sentiment, pinpoint critical areas of service delivery, and make data-driven decisions to enhance customer experience. The project supports British Airways' management, customer service teams, and marketing strategists in strategizing for improved customer satisfaction and competitiveÂ advantage.
